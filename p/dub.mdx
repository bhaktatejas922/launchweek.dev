## how Dub launched

### anouncements

Dub made three announcements:

1. Introducing Dub Conversions
2. Introducing Webhooks
3. Unveiling Dub's new About page

For the announcements, Dub mostly applied two tactics:

- Publish one announcement per day on their blog
- Spread the news on Twitter/X

    Here's a wrap-up of Dub's first-ever launch week

## key takeaways

Some learnings from this launch week:

- If we define launch weeks as a week of announcing new features, they don't _have to_ last 5 days though. Dub's launch week lasted 3 days.
- Day 1 had the most impact on social engagement, and Dub crushed it with 143.7K impressions.
- Related: Pull in customers and partners as much as possible. Dub may have reached this level of engagement because it featured partners like Stripe, Clerk, and Supabase.
- Post a recap of your announcements to keep the momentum going. This is good for SEO, and it could still reach people who either forgot, ignored, or missed them the first time.

That's a wrap!
