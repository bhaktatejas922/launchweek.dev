Zeno Rocha puts it simply: launch weeks are high peaks. So, you may want to maximize the compound effect and launch on places like Product Hunt, too.

## why it's important

Product Hunt definitely is a great place to launch on launch week — a place where many developer-first products launched successfully during their launch weeks: Supabase, Inkeep, and Raycast, to name a few.

Supabase launched [Supabase UI on Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com/products/supabase#supabase-ui) during Supabase Launch Week I and ranked #1 Product of the Day and #2 Product of the Week. So did [Inkeep](https://producthunt.com/products/inkeep#inkeep), ranked #3 Product of the Day, and Raycast with [Raycast for Teams](https://lweek.dev/ray/teams), ranked #4 Product of the Day.

According to [similarweb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/producthunt.com/#overview), it gets 4.8 million unique visitors every month, and according to [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker/?input=producthunt.com), it has a domain rating of 91.

Launching on Product Hunt keeps reminding you that your company exists and you're making progress. You stay top-of-mind, and in the context of a launch week, you can keep it really simple.
