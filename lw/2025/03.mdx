Every week is launch week. This week `W10` was Railway Launch Week 02.

Railway is an out-of-the-box git to deployment platform with auto-scaling, DBs, secrets, rollbacks, and more.

**key takeaways**

From my perspective, it's key to announce your launch week in advance to raise awareness and start building momentum. Railway really nailed it. They announced their launch week two weeks in advance in their [changelog](https://railway.com/changelog/2025-02-21-railway-launch-week-march) and on socials. Later on, they shipped a beautifully crafted [landing page](https://railway.com/launch-week-02). Some companies take launch weeks seriously and they stand out.
